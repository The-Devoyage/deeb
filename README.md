# Deeb - JSON Database

Prounced `D-B`, Deeb is an Acid Compliant JSON based database for small 
websites and fast prototyping. 

Inspired by simplicity of Mongo and light weight of SqLite, Deeb is a tool 
that turns a set of JSON files into a database. 

While performing migrations will be possible, Deeb's JSON database
allows you to simply open a json file and edit as needed.
